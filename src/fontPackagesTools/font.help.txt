Embedded fonts are often used in flash project: they allows things
like rotation/alpha effects on text, plus end user is not forced to have
the fonts installed to his system.

However, there are drawbacks: 
- swf size grows
- project needs to be recompiled each time a new font has to be added/removed

But here comes "runtime font loading" : a new tecnique which allows flash 
movies/components to load fonts from external file.

Basicly it works like that:

- main movie has no embedded fonts
- each font is embedded in a single swf called font package (FP)
- main movie loads font package only when needed

This means more flexibility and less work, since once you have created
a bunch of FP, you can reuse them each time you want.

FP can be built with FLASH IDE or with FLEX opensource sdk; this folder contains
examples for using both methods, each one with his pros/cons:

FLASH IDE has a simpler setup and works also with bitmap fonts but CS3 is needed,
and you are forced to embed entire fonts instead of custom defined characters ranges

FLEX sdk allows you to choose which chars to embed for each fonts, can be freely
downloaded from ADOBE but has a lesser simple setup and doesn't work with bitmap fonts.

Both methods are able to generate FPs made by one or more fonts: think like
embedding normal, bold and italic style of a specific font in a single FP.

Let's start from folder structure:

- fonts .ttf files
- flex  .as FLEX examples
- flash .fla FLASH examples
- test  .swf testing folder

test.as     \
test.swf     > test application for checking FPs
test.html   /

Once built a swf FP, just put it in the test folder, run test.html, select the FP and
if all is ok, you'll see the names of all embedded fonts.

************ FLASH - BEFORE START ************

First things is: you need to install (on windows) each font before building the relative FP.
To compile provided examples, open the "fonts" and install all bundled .ttf 

"flash" folder contains 4 examples:

1) Vera.fla     Bitstream Vera Sans (normal)
2) VeraBold.fla Bitstream Vera Sans (bold)
3) Vera.fla     Bitstream Vera Sans (normal + bold)
4) Silkscreen   Silkscreen (bitmap)

1,2,4 are single font FPs, while is multiple font FP

Open one example (or more), publish it, copy the generated swf in the test folder and run
test.html to see how it looks.

************ FLASH - SINGLE FONT FP ************

We'll see now how to build FP for single new font "Caviar Dreams": so first download it from: 

http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/Caviar-Dreams

Unpack the archive in the "font" folder and install all the fonts (on windows), then:

01) Open "flash" folder
02) Open Vera.fla
03) Save as: CaviarDreams
04) Double click "A" in library
05) Choose "Caviar Dreams" and click OK
06) Go to File menu and click on publish
07) Save the fla

You should now see "CaviarDreams.swf" in the "flash" folder, move it in the "test" folder,
run test.html, click the "Browse" button, choose CaviarDreams.swf and click "Check".

If a "Caviar Dreams" text formatted with the new font is showed, everything worked as expected and
the "CaviarDreams.swf" FP is ready

Please remember to always use the displayed text as font name, in this case use "Caviar Dreams" and
not "CaviarDreams" or things won't work.

************ FLASH - MULTIPLE FONT FP ************

We'll see now how to build FP for multiple styles (normal and bold) of "Caviar Dreams",
see previous example for how to install the font, then:

01) Open "flash" folder
02) Open VeraPack.fla
03) Save as: CaviarDreamsPack
04) Double click "A" next to "Vera" in library
05) Change name from "Vera" to "Caviar Dreams"
06) Choose "Caviar Dreams" from dropdown list and click OK
07) Right click on "A" next to "Vera" in library and choose "Linkage"
08) Change class from "Vera" to "CaviarDreams"
09) Double click "A" next to "Vera (bold)" in library
10) Change name from "Vera (bold)" to "Caviar Dreams (bold)"
11) Choose "Caviar Dreams" from dropdown list, check bold and click OK
12) Right click on "A" next to "Vera (bold)" in library and choose "Linkage"
13) Change class from "VeraBold" to "CaviarDreamsBold"
14) Edit actionscript code on first frame
15) Change "Font.registerFont(Vera)" to "Font.registerFont(CaviarDreams)"
16) Change "Font.registerFont(VeraBold)" to "Font.registerFont(CaviarDreamsBold)"
17) Go to File menu and click on publish
18) Save the fla

Test the "CaviarDreamsPack.swf" FP as explained in the previous examples but this time
you should see 2 "Caviar Dreams" texts, one for each embedded style (normal and bold)


************ FLEX - BEFORE START ************

Flex method doesn't force you install (on windows) the fonts, since it works directly with
.ttf files.
Other benefit is that you can defined which char range you need for each font.
However, it doesn't work with bitmap fonts so, in this case, use the Flash method.

Please note: for use Flex, you need to have Java installed on your system

First thing is download opensource sdk from ADOBE:

http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+3

from "Stable Builds", click on the first "Open Source Flex SDK"

Unpack the archive in a folder and call it "flexSDK"

01) Open the "flex" folder
02) Move "build.bat" and "font-config.xml" in the "flexSDK" folder
03) Create a shortcut for "build.bat" in the "flexSDK" folder
04) Move the shortcut from "flexSDK" to "flex" folder and name it "build"

Setup is ready, to compile FPs just drag one (or more) examples .as files
on the build shortcut.

When the build process ends, you'll get the swfs in the same "flex" folder.

************ FLEX - SINGLE FONT FP ************

We'll see now how to build FP for single new font "Caviar Dreams": so first download it from: 

http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/Caviar-Dreams

03) Change class from "Vera" to "CaviarDreams"
04) Change "source" from "../fonts/Vera.ttf" to "../fonts/CaviarDreams.ttf"
05) Change "fontFamily" from "Bitstream Vera Sans" to "Caviar Dreams"
06) Save
07) Drag CaviarDreams.as on "build"

"CaviarDreams.swf" FP has been built in the "flex" folder, you can test it as explained in FLASH section.

************ FLEX - MULTIPLE FONT FP ************

We'll see now how to build FP for multiple styles (normal and bold) of "Caviar Dreams",
